for a first time git user: run the ff cmd:
first create a folder you will be working on then run the cmd in it
run: git init
then the ff steps

#step 1:NB: this should be the email you used when registering for gitHub
  git config --global user.email "<your email address>"
#step 2:
  git config --global user.name "<Your name>"

after this you can start doing some work :)

once you done run:
  git add "<list of files you were working on>"
then run: git commit -m "<some commit comment>"

you can run: git status
 at anytime to check where the file(s) you working on are committed, 
 need to be commited, ready to be committed and etc.

you can also run: git log 
 to see the history of commits made

now after all these, go to GitHub and create a new repo.
Just give it a name then copy the "linking url" after creating it.
It should look something like this:
 git remote add origin https://github.com/u16220073/Narau.git

then run: git push -u origin master.

Now say changes are made on the server repo on gitHub.
To synch the changes to your local repo on you pc first run:
  git fetch origin master
then: git merge origin/master

alternatively you can run: git pull orign master
which fetches and merges simulteneously.

NB: use a "git pull origin master" if you know there are no
conflicts other wisen it will fail.

to break from one repo to another you use:
  git remote remove origin
then:
  git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<new-repo-name>.git

Let's say when you were creating your repl on GitHub you chose one
with an initialized readme.md

if that's the case then you won't be able to push or pull until
you do the following
first run: git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
then you can run: git push origin master
